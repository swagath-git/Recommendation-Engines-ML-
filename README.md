# Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to build and evaluate a Recommendation Engine capable of suggesting items based on user–item interaction data.
The notebook covers the end-to-end workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and insights visualization.

# Key Features
  1. Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and structuring data for analysis
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding user trends and correlations
 
  3. Model Building – Implemented algorithms such as:
     (i)Collaborative Filtering
     (ii)Content-Based Filtering
     (iii)Hybrid Recommendation (if applicable)

  4. Evaluation Metrics – Measures like RMSE, Precision@K, and Recall@K
  5. Visualization – Insights represented using Matplotlib/Seaborn

# Technologies & Libraries Used

  1. Python
  2. Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
  3. Scikit-learn – Machine learning algorithms
  4. Surprise / Recommender Systems Libraries (if used)
  5. Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
  6. Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

# Results & Insights
  1. The recommendation model successfully identifies similar users/items.
  2. Demonstrates improved accuracy and relevant recommendations after tuning parameters.
  3. Visual insights provide a better understanding of user engagement trends.
